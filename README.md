<p>👋 Hello! I'm Leon-Kay, a software developer based in Suzhou, China. I was born after 2000 and specialize in crafting innovative solutions. With over 1.5 years of experience in software development, I possess strong programming acumen and a knack for independent exploration and research in new domains.</p>
<p>🧠 I thrive on challenges. In October 2021, I first encountered research on blockchain and cryptocurrency, which gradually cultivated my strong interest. It wasn't until December 2023 that I officially began delving into blockchain technology. My goal is to establish a career in this field. Here's an overview of my study plan:</p>

<p>🚀 I love collaboration and am eager to explore new knowledge and opportunities. Whether it's developing cutting-edge applications or delving into blockchain development, I'm prepared to challenge myself.</p>
<p>📫 You can reach me at leontechvoyage@gmail.com || WeChat: lk34041515. Let's create something amazing together!</p>
<p>⚡ Fun fact: Not only am I a coder, but also a late-night food researcher. Research shows that code and food make the best combination!</p>
<p>Next, I have more challenges to tackle. Ultimately, I aim to become a senior blockchain architect with extensive experience in blockchain development, a strong technical background, and leadership skills. Feel free to get in touch, and let's explore the future of blockchain together!</p>
