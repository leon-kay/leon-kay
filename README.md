<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Leon-Kay, a software developer hailing from Suzhou, China, born after 2000. I specialize in crafting innovative solutions and have over a year of experience in the software development field. I'm proficient in WPF, C#, and various communication protocols.</p>
<p>ðŸ§  I'm passionate about challenges. I dipped my toes into the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in October 2021, slowly cultivating a deep interest. It wasn't until December 2023 that I began formally studying blockchain technology. I aspire to build my career in this domain. Here's what I've learned through self-study:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understanding JavaScript, a core language for modern web development.</li>
  <li>Grasping basic concepts in blockchain, including blocks, blockchain, consensus mechanisms, etc.</li>
  <li>Understanding the workings and characteristics of Ethereum and other mainstream blockchain platforms.</li>
  <li>Currently learning the syntax of Solidity language and common design patterns.</li>
  <li>Proficient in writing and debugging smart contracts.</li>
  <li>Familiar with popular smart contract development frameworks like Truffle and Hardhat.</li>
  <li>Understanding common commands and functionalities within these frameworks, able to quickly create, compile, and deploy smart contracts.</li>
  <li>Deep understanding of various vulnerabilities and attack methods in smart contracts, learning how to write secure smart contracts.</li>
  <li>Knowledgeable about optimization techniques for smart contracts, including gas cost optimization, storage optimization, etc., to enhance contract performance and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>ðŸš€ I love collaboration and am eager to explore new knowledge and opportunities. Whether it's developing cutting-edge applications or delving into blockchain development, I'm prepared to challenge myself.</p>
<p>ðŸ“« You can reach me at leontechvoyage@gmail.com || WeChat: lk34041515. Let's create something amazing together!</p>
<p>âš¡ Fun fact: Not only am I a coder, but also a late-night food researcher. Research shows that code and food make the best combination!</p>
<p>Next, I have more challenges to tackle. Ultimately, I aim to become a senior blockchain architect with extensive experience in blockchain development, a strong technical background, and leadership skills. Feel free to get in touch, and let's explore the future of blockchain together!</p>
